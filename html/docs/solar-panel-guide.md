# Solar Panel Alignment Guide

Optimize your Orpheus solar power system for maximum efficiency.

## Understanding Solar Panel Positioning

Proper solar panel alignment is critical for maintaining adequate charge in remote deployments. This guide covers optimal positioning for various conditions and locations.

## Basic Principles

### Direction (Azimuth)

The panel should face the equator:

| Hemisphere | Panel Should Face |
|------------|-------------------|
| Northern Hemisphere | South |
| Southern Hemisphere | North |

### Tilt Angle

The optimal tilt angle varies by season and latitude.

**General Rule:** Tilt angle ≈ Your latitude

| Season | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Winter | Add 15° (steeper angle) |
| Summer | Subtract 15° (flatter angle) |
| Spring/Autumn | Use latitude angle |

#### Why Seasonal Adjustment Matters

- **Winter:** The sun is lower in the sky. A steeper panel angle captures more of the low-angle winter sunlight.
- **Summer:** The sun is higher in the sky. A flatter panel angle prevents the sun from "overshooting" the panel.

## Tilt Angle Reference Table

| Latitude | Winter Tilt | Spring/Fall Tilt | Summer Tilt |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| 25° | 40° | 25° | 10° |
| 30° | 45° | 30° | 15° |
| 35° | 50° | 35° | 20° |
| 40° | 55° | 40° | 25° |
| 45° | 60° | 45° | 30° |
| 50° | 65° | 50° | 35° |

> **Tip:** If you can only set one angle for the entire year, use your latitude angle. This provides the best average performance across all seasons.

## Shade Avoidance

Shade is the enemy of solar charging.

### Critical Rules

1. **Avoid ANY shade during peak sun hours** (10 AM - 2 PM)
2. **Check for seasonal shade changes** - trees may shade differently as sun angle changes
3. **Morning shade is better than afternoon shade** - batteries charge faster in morning
4. **Partial shade affects entire panel** - even small shadows drastically reduce output

### Common Shade Sources

- Trees (including branches that grow seasonally)
- Buildings or structures
- The Orpheus unit itself (mount panel away from unit)
- Nearby equipment or posts
- Snow accumulation in winter

## Seasonal Adjustment Schedule

For optimal year-round performance, adjust your panel angle quarterly:

| Month | Action |
|-------|--------|
| March 21 | Adjust to Spring angle (latitude) |
| June 21 | Adjust to Summer angle (latitude - 15°) |
| September 21 | Adjust to Fall angle (latitude) |
| December 21 | Adjust to Winter angle (latitude + 15°) |

> **Note:** If adjusting quarterly isn't practical, a fixed angle at your latitude works reasonably well year-round.

## Expected Power Output

Solar panel output varies significantly based on conditions:

| Condition | Typical Output |
|-----------|----------------|
| Full direct sun | 80-100% of rated power |
| Bright overcast | 40-60% of rated power |
| Heavy overcast | 10-25% of rated power |
| Shade | 0-10% of rated power |

### Geographic Considerations

Annual solar energy availability varies by location:

| Region Type | Daily Average (Peak Sun Hours) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Desert/Arid | 6-7 hours |
| Temperate | 4-5 hours |
| Northern/Cloudy | 2-3 hours |
| Tropical | 5-6 hours |

## Troubleshooting Low Power

### Panel Appears Clean But Low Output

1. **Check angle** - May need seasonal adjustment
2. **Check direction** - Verify facing equator
3. **Check for micro-shade** - Small branches or wires casting shadows
4. **Check connections** - Ensure MC4 connectors are tight
5. **Check panel condition** - Look for damage, discoloration

### Battery Not Reaching Full Charge

1. **Increase solar capacity** - Add additional panel(s)
2. **Reduce power consumption** - Enable deep sleep, reduce active hours
3. **Improve panel placement** - Better angle, less shade
4. **Check battery health** - May need replacement

### Intermittent Charging

1. **Check for loose connections** - Vibration can loosen MC4
2. **Look for intermittent shade** - Moving branches
3. **Inspect cable damage** - Animals may chew cables

## Installation Tips

### Mounting Options

1. **Ground mount** - Easy to adjust, watch for ground-level shade
2. **Pole mount** - Good elevation, consider wind loading
3. **Tree/structure mount** - Convenient but watch for shade

### Cable Management

- Use UV-resistant cable ties
- Protect cables from animals (conduit if needed)
- Allow slack for panel angle adjustments
- Keep MC4 connections off the ground

### Security Considerations

- Use tamper-resistant hardware
- Consider camouflage in sensitive areas
- Document panel location with GPS
